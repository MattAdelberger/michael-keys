                            Born and raised in the south suburbs of Chicago IL, Michael Keys grew up listening to the styles of old and modern country music. He was 
                            introduced to it from his father who woulddrive around with their local country radio station on and Michael would sing along to the radio.
                            Coming from a non-musicial background, Michael kept his talent hidden from anyone outside of the comfort of his home until one day he grew the courage 
                            to perform at his high school's talent show. Not only did Michael manage to compete with other talented individuals, but he actually took first place of
                            the competition. It was that moment that Michael knew he needed to treat music more than just a hobby.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since then, Michael has been taking music up by storm. He started off as a lead singer for cover bands in the classic rock and country music genre. Placed the 
                            best clubs and festivals all around the Midwest. In his spare time, Michael was all working on songwriting. He wanted the world to see him more than just a performer
                            so he had been writing songs in country music for the past few years. His songs earned him the oppurtunity to play at the 2018 Country Thunder Wisconsin festival and open up
                            for national touring artist, Sam Hunt. After that experience Michael knew that he needed to pursue his songwriting more. Now residing in Nashville, TN, Michael has used His
                            experience in songwriting and performing to become a one of a kind entertainer. There is only one thing that Michael loves to do and that is to give the audience a show they
                            will never forget.
